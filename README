main.py
app.get("/") is used as an endpoint to verify functionality between front end and back end and returns the standard Hello World
@app.get("/get_daily_test_data") is used as an endpoint to read the csv data and return the data as a json response

read_csv.py
def read_csv(): is a function call to open the csv file and convert the data into a list[dict{}]
def read_csv_locally(): is a function call to open the csv file and convert the data into a list[dict{}]. This program is only intended to be run locally to verify correct reading and output of csv file.

# Improvements

Enable the use of CSRF tokens in a deployed environment.
Move function call of app.get("/get_daily_test_data") into it's own python file to handle better segregation of code.
